09:57pm - this is the second entry in the
this engineering notebook
 
so from my best recollection of the meeting 
the highlights of the meeting are we talked about image processing and git repositories

first image processing 
caleb was thinking about adding a rasberry pi to the competition robot which will be used to 
do the image processing since it will be faster than just the roborio 
and has better support for openCV
the team has not come to any official decision as far as am aware.

now about the git repositories 
our mentor which cant remember his name showed  us a different way to run our  git repos 
our team is currently  deciding how to approach the git repos. 
demetri which is the build master. offered a another that involving rotating the yearly folders 
to an archive

from the team reaction I believe we are in favor of the mentors plan

Issac (one of the  8th graders) started to learn about version control systems
I am not sure how much he got out of the talking about the mentors plan.
