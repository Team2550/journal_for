07:50pm - notes on new development enviroment


12:38am - i know that we need codeblocks and eclipse and also git and the git gui's 
since most of this can be installed with just an install script.
i was going to try this on the of my flash drives.
but since i dont have a flash drive that is 8gb big i am going to have to buy one.
the current problem with the existing flash drive is that the sources list for downloading
 new packages has been destroyed. thus making that install script pretty much useless
and i have to consider reinstalling the operating system on already most working flash drive.


hopefully we be able to get working install scripts soon.
brayton blames me for the sources list not working but i am absoutley certain that my install script had nothing todo with the sources list breaking.
