03:10pm - nathan wants multiple cameras
i talked to lance yesterday and he told me that we have working code for the test robot.
nathan agrees that we should use a rasberry pi.
nathan got distracted by his science project.

03:31pm - teaching nathan w how to use git hub
i realized that we have two nathans so i have decided to call one of them stanley
 
03:32pm - carter(white shoes) and tristan (flying hair)

carter doesnt really know how to program. 
he understand variables and printing to the console as well as getting input. 

tristan knows alot about programming. 	

04:33pm - brayton thinks that should be writing the camera code in python.
i also forget that lance said that we should be running the code on the roborio.
 
nathan said that we needed a new programming laptop that is under 600 dollars.
my guess is that we dont actually need that new laptop.
we just need to fix the inconsistencent development enviroment.
